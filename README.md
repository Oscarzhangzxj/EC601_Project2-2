### 1.Introduction

The aim of this project is to call Google's natural language processing API to perform sentiment analysis on text, including the overall sentiment tendency
of the text and the overall intensity of the sentiment in the text. The text used is taken from various movie clips. I will use these movie line clips to
test the API which I use.

### 2.Qucik Start

(https://cloud.google.com/natural-language)

&emsp;&emsp; Replace filename.txt with the text file you want to test

### 3.MVP and User story
- ***User***:  
Consultant, Advisors, Project Manager

- ***Mission***:   
Use entity analysis to find and tag fields in documents, including emails, chat conversations, and social media posts, and then perform
sentiment analysis to understand customer perceptions to gain valuable product and user experience insights. 

- ***MVP(Minimum Valuable Product)***:  
This system can analyze the emotional tendency of each sentence in the text, and then combine the emotional intensity and emotional direction of each sentence to determine the emotional state of the entire text creator.

- ***User stories***:  
For a legal consultant, product manager, etc. who needs to communicate with customers, when they receive emails from customers or when customers communicate with them, they need a sentiment analysis system to help them comprehensively understand customers' emotions and perceptions, andthrough aggregation, they can obtain practical solutions to further enhance the user experience. This can better think from the user's point of view
and facilitate practitioners to solve problems more efficiently.

### 4.Example show
- ***Interpreting Sentiment Analysis Values***:  
The sentiment score of a document indicates the overall sentiment of the document. The magnitude of a
document's sentiment indicates how much emotional content is present in the document, and this value is usually proportional to the length of the
document.Be sure to use magnitude values to adjust your scores when comparing documents to each other, as they can help measure the amount of relevant 
emotional content.
