### 1.Introduction

The aim of this project is to call Google's natural language processing API to perform sentiment analysis on text, including the overall sentiment tendency
of the text and the overall intensity of the sentiment in the text. The text used is taken from various movie clips. I will use these movie line clips to
test the API which I use.
